            <p>I made a new journal. I'm not sure what to name it, but I think what I have is fine for now. I've been wanting another place to write my thoughts for some time, but I didn't have the chance to make it. Luckily, we weren't doing anything during Spanish today so I put together some code from my older journal to make this.</p>
            <p>The background is a picture of a cairn I made in Alaska. We were staying in our RV by a lake or the sea when I went to the shore and constructed the cairn with Jamie. Whenever I think of that one stone structure, I recall all the things that happened during that week - experiencing the idyllic Alaskan landscape, being cooped up in the RV, and seeing my family fall to pieces in the span of a few days.</p>
            <p>I made this journal to be another cairn for me. The entries will pile up like stones on the water, and when I look back, hopefully I'll be able to remember everything that happens from this moment to when I leave for college. That's an assumption I've been making - that I'd stop writing entirely after leaving high school. I'm not sure if I'll stop writing then, or even if I'll continue writing until next August, but who knows?</p>
            <p>Anyways, I've been pretty stressed recently, or at least this week, especially today. I've been brushing my grades up - Lang is mostly set and BC Calc is fine as long as I get above a 92 on the final. Spanish is the problem, though - My grade is on the border of being an A, but all the quizzes this quarter have weighed me down. I used to ace all the vocab quizzes, but for some reason I haven't been doing as well. We only have a few assignments left for the school year, too.</p>
            <p>I don't know. I've been stressed about a lot of things - scioly, my family, school, AP tests, my friends, my internship... There are so many things on my mind. Those things built up in the time I didn't write things down. The most stressful thing is Spanish, but right behind is picking next year's Vice President for scioly. Of course I want to pick Jamie, but Mrs. Babcock has her reservations, and Jamie isn't necessarily perfectly ready. She needs to grow, but that's a topic for another time.</p>
            <p>At least the other officer positions were easy to decide - James will be Parent Liaison, Morgan will be Logistics Officer, Matthew will be Build Captain, and Nick will be Secretary. I was actually surprised with the last one, but it makes sense - I had been undervaluing Nick this entire time. He's so committed, and he actually shared really unique ideas during his interview. And it's not like he's a bad performer; he earned so many medals this year.</p>

            <p>I'm so panicked right now. I can't stop thinking about everything that could happen - what if I fail the AP Chem test? What if I don't end Spanish with an A? What if Dr. Oh cancels the internship on me? What if I'm not good enough to be an intern?</p>
            <p>I ran two miles last night at 11 PM because I couldn't fall asleep. But I was even less tired after running, so I didn't fall asleep until 12. I don't feel tired though, which is strange.</p>
            <p>Before my run, I talked with Indra for about an hour. We talked about Joseph, Hailey, and Mrs. Babcock. I also said I might ask Morgan to go to prom with me, only to find out from her that you had to go with a senior. That was embarrassing. But now Indra thinks I'm head over heels for Morgan. But it's not that simple. I used to think relationships in high school was stupid, but look at where I am now.</p>
            <p>I'm so screwed. I keep thinking that, and to clear my mind, I'll run again. But when I come back, I'll 100% be too tired to study for the AP Chem test.</p>

            <p>I've been studying a lot of chem this weekend. I've reviewed up to Unit 7, and hopefully I'll finish with my notes in two hours. I did better on the last MCQ I did - 40/50, or 80% - which is well within the range of getting a 5. That's progress.</p>
            <p>I had a call with Hailey yesterday evening. She was surveying high school students for a project she was doing, and she asked what I thought about having an AI college counselor. I was outside the entire time so I was cold and distracted, so I probably came off as an NPC. Since she was the one who contacted me through Discord, I guess things have changed with her and Joseph.</p>

            <p>The AP Chem test was yesterday. Why was that the best AP test I've ever taken? There were very few things I didn't know, and after talking with my friends, I'm pretty sure I got at least some of the stuff I wasn't sure about correct. Watch me get a 4 after saying that.</p>
            <p>APUSH is more of a concern, though. I've been doing well on the SAQs and FRQs - only once have I not gotten a perfect score on those - but I'm a little shaky on the content. I was going to start reviewing content today, but I couldn't because I had to do other things.</p>
            <p>Dr. Hong offered to review my paper, so I emailed her, but apparently my message wasn't personal enough so she got kind of put off. After I finished my CS lab, I spent most of the day writing a response to her email. I couldn't really understand what she wanted, since I was hearing it through my mother. Regardless, we have only five days until our paper is due, so it's not like she can do much to help our paper.</p>
            <p>And about our paper, it's due this Sunday. We also have to make travel reservations by Tuesday, and our video by Saturday. I still have three APs to do, so I don't know how I'll be able to do everything. I better not pull a Matthew and "do science fair in the day, AP grind at night." I'm so cooked.</p>

            <p>I'm so stressed that I can't study for APUSH. I just called Dr. Min to let her know about Stockholm and how I had to finish our paper and write our video. I said I would try to make the concert on Saturday Kyle's mother had bought tickets for, but she just told me not to worry and dismissed me altogether. She initially congratulated me, but she didn't sound too happy and I talked kind of fast. Why am I such a terrible student...</p>
            <p>Things don't feel like they're going smoothly lately. I thought the year would have a streamlined ending - my grades were gradually going up, scioly had ended, and science fair was over... Except I still have to worry about Calc and Spanish, I have to decide next year's scioly officers, and Stockholm is due in three days. Not to mention, I have all of my AP tests and other clubs to worry about. And SEAP.</p>
            <p>On a side note, why are my mother and father such terrible parents? My father doesn't know how to do anything, and he's just as financially dependent on my mother as me and my sister. My mother doesn't acknowledge any of the problems in our household, and the only thing she teaches us is that it's okay to lie to our father and do things behind his back. I don't know what they think is a family, and I cannot even remotely imagine what kind of example they're setting for us. </p>
            <p>I've noticed that the less time I spend in school, the more upset I am. That's why I love scioly so much - no, it's why I <i>need</i> scioly. I need a purpose, something that will help me ignore things that aren't going as well. Maybe it's self-deception. But I don't care. Too bad I'm too burnt out to do any scioly work...</p>
            <p>I don't know. Regardless of how I feel, I need to study for APUSH. I kind of want to talk to Morgan right now, though.</p>

            <p>My APUSH test was today. It wasn't bad, except I could have done better. Previously, I've done really well on the MCQ's - on the past full practices, I only got 5 wrong out of 54 or 55 questions. And that was always with time to spare. The MCQ for this year's test was actually really easy, but I freaking fell asleep during the test and did the last 20 questions half asleep. I ran out of time at the end, and I didn't check around 10 questions. The SAQ wasn't bad, but I was tired for that too. Luckily, the DBQ and LEQ were decent. I could have added more commentary, but I met all of the other requirements so hopefully I'm fine.</p>

            <p>I had a really profound conversation with Katie. I don't know why, but she's the only person I've had genuine conversations with. Nobody asks me how I feel or what thoughts are truly in my head... and yet what I tell Katie is just a fraction of what goes on in my mind.</p>
            <p>Out of the blue, Katie asked me what motivates me. I thought it was a general question, but it was directed at me. Maybe I escalated things too quickly, but I answered honestly: I'm motivated because I have to be the best at everything, and that failure means death to me. I don't know why that mindset is ingrained in me. Every day, I think about how I have to be at the top, #1, completely unmatched. I can't tolerate the idea of being anything less, much less failing. Failure is like death to me - no, failure is worse than death to me. Death is so easy - you're gone in an instant, and you have nothing to hold you back anymore. Who cares about whoever's left behind when they're dead? If I die on the spot right now, I won't be around to feel bad about my family mourning over my body. What's real, or could be real, is only so because I can perceive it now, and when I'm dead, none of it matters. But failure is different. If I fail, I've condemned myself to mediocrity. I've reduced the meaning of my existence. My very essence... is worthless. I feel that I'm alive only to be the best, and if I'm not, then I'm a complete waste. Death is only a transition and an easy way out, but failure is something that has no alternative.</p>
            <p>Earlier in the year, I apologized to Katie and Morgan for doing poorly at Georgia, and Katie sent a long text about how I shouldn't drive myself too hard. She brought that text up again, but I couldn't help ignoring it. Being the best and driving myself to the limits is who I am. If I don't work to be the best, then I'm not anything.</p>
            <p>Admittedly, my mindset can be hard to deal with at times. I had a really tough time after getting 2nd at science fair last year. The night after the fair, I woke up at 3am and threw up in my toilet. I was clutching the bowl with my hands, utterly helpless, asking, <i>Why had I failed? Why hadn't I done better?</i> With my mouth tasting of vomit, I crawled back to my room, still wracked with pain. As I kneeled on the ground, I reached for my scioly medals. I sat against the wall on the floor, and feeling the cold metal on me, I cried, clutching my medals.</p>
            <p>I was sick for the entire week after. I probably ate like three meals for the next four days. But I don't think I've changed much since then.</p>
            <p>On a brighter note, I've realized that I've tried so many new things this year. James was the first real friend who bought food for me themselves. I had a meal with more than two friends for the first time. I also have my first friend group - or quasi-friend group, I'm not sure. I've also told someone a bit about my family situation and have had conversations with a person where I've been truly honest. I realized something else when I was walking home today in the rain, but I can't recall now. It was a very clear revelation, but now I've lost it.</p>

            <p>I just submitted our National Stockholm Junior Water Prize paper. I changed some things to meet the national requirements, but I didn't really change anything else. I have no clue if we're going to do well at Nationals. At least we'll get a medal during the award ceremony, though. Kind of like a scioly medal, except it's a guaranteed 6th place.</p>
            <p>I have to study BC Calculus now, but I don't know if I should stay up. I woke up at 9:30 today because my alarm didn't go off for some reason, so I want to get off my computer as soon as possible. That means not checking the answers, which isn't ideal. I don't think I'm screwed, but I want a bit more FRQ practice.</p>

            <p>I had my AP Lang test today. It went... not well. I did far worse than I've done on the MCQ, since I was half sleeping for the entirety of it. My written responses were pretty bad, too - I should expect a 4 for my score, which is kind of sad.</p>
            <p>But hey, at least my AP tests are over. I hung out in Mrs. Babcock's room during 6th and 8th period and got to watch 7 episodes of AOT. I actually can't wait to watch more, but I'll have to wait until tomorrow, since my father will be gone by then. I need to find out what happens to Eren and Ymir after Reiner and Bertholdt captured them.</p>
            <p>Overall, my AP's didn't go terribly, aside from Lang. I think I did decently on Chem, APUSH, and Calc. I'll just have to wait until June to find out how things went.</p>
            <p>This is irrelevant, but recently I kind of got into Dartmouth. I got two promotion packets from the school, and after looking through them, I got instantly hooked. I just like how the campus is isolated and surrounded by nature. There was also a Dartmouth student I knew in a packet - he went to Mitchell's tennis a few times, and I did MathCounts with him in 8th grade, so it was surprising to see someone I had known from a distance get into the school. One of Dr. Min's students also got into Dartmouth as well, so I'll ask her about the school.</p>
            <p>Of course, Dartmouth hasn't replaced MIT or Princeton. I won't ED to the school since their Environmental Studies program is only okay, but it'll still be one of top choices. Environmental Studies and the D-Plan sounds hella interesting.</p>

            <p>My grades are looking better. I finally have an A in Calc because Mr. Kim gave everyone free points for their practice FRQs. My final is exactly a 92.50, but it shouldn't go down because I'll have the final project and the midterm/final grade to boost my grade further. Lang is also going really well too, since I have a 97.3 right now and my final is a 93.1. Spanish was the problem - my final is a 91.8 - but I did the math, and as long as I get 10/10 on the last two quizzes, 10/10 on the homework, and 10/10 and 9/10 for the written and oral PALS, I'll have a 92.5 final. I wouldn't be worrying this much if I had been so lazy with my quizzes... Why didn't I bother to check my answers another time? My quiz grades were always terrible and weighed me down.</p>

            <p>I had the craziest dream last night. First, I dreamed that I was emailing Zahra for something about scioly, and for some reason she was telling me in an email that I should've put Lavanya on States instead of the other States members. I also dreamed about my AP tests - I took 5 tests in my dream, one that I had self-studied for, but I only remember the scores of the 4 I actually took. The MyAP portal was broken so I had a hard time finding the scores, but I ended up getting 5s in Chem and Calc and 4s in Lang and APUSH. The last two scores were really sad because Lang is supposed to be easy, and I want to do well in APUSH. I actually think those scores are the most likely to happen, considering how poorly I did on the Lang and APUSH tests.</p>

            <p>I haven't written in my journal for nearly a month. A lot has happened, especially since we're close to the end of the school year. Some good, some bad. But more than anything, I think I'm uneasily anticipating this summer and the upcoming school year.</p>
            <p>I'm ending Spanish with a 92.3, which is really sad. To be fair, it's all my fault - I didn't know what I was doing 1st quarter, and I wasn't careful enough this quarter and failed most of the quizzes. It was a preventable disaster, but I was too ignorant to protect my grade earlier in the quarter. I did better in my other classes - I'll end Lang with an A and my BC final grade is actually higher than that of Lang (93.5 vs 92.8) because I aced the final. My final grades for other classes are A's, of course. But that doesn't make up for the fact that I foolishly got an A in Spanish.</p>
            <p>Although I didn't mention it in my previous entry, I ended up picking Jamie for Vice President. I think it was the right choice - no, it was the right choice. Anything else would have been poor judgment. Jamie is the only one who has the drive and commitment to take on the mantle of leadership after me. She has <i>so</i> much to learn next year, though.</p>
            <p>I also had a piano concert two weeks ago - I played Chopin's Polonaise in A Flat major. I didn't play as well as I did before, but considering my minimal level of preparation, it went pretty well - I only made a minor stumble, and I went through the hard parts pretty well. I also had dinner at Fogo de Chao with two of Dr. Min's other students, Kyle and Jasmine. Both go to TJ and had a lot in common, but it was really fun talking to them because I knew some things about TJ. They're also mildly sweaty, so we were on the same page for a lot of things, like applying to college.</p>
            <p>About college, I made a draft list of universities I'll be applying to this fall. The cost of the applications is already $1,350, which is quite a lot, especially if I'm going to be paying with my SEAP stipend.</p>

            <p>I just got honor coded for my Data Structures class. The whole situation is really stupid. Apparently a guy named Preston took my labs on GitHub and submitted them without even changing my name, and Dr. Oberle noticed that and called him out. Apparently the kid just has to redo some alternative labs, but Dr. Oberle sent me an email notifying me of an honor code violation. I didn't even send the code to him - how was I supposed to know that he would take my exact code and submit it? I know I didn't need to post my files on GitHub, and I'll make everything private after I talk with Dr. Oberle. But I don't know why that kid had to be such an idiot. And the reason I had my labs up there in the first place was so that people looking at my code would know it's mine - why else would I include my name and the date in every single program that I write?</p>
            <p>I'm sure everything will be fine after I talk with Dr. Oberle. But it's kind of dumb how I have to go through all this. I'll definitely take down my labs from GitHub from Dr. Oberle, though. </p>

            <p>Today is my second day working as a naval intern for SEAP. I shouldn't be writing this right now, but I couldn't help it. My mentor is out of town this week on a business trip, so I'm working in the office by myself. Susumu introduced me to the lab and the people in it, and they were great. But being in this small cubicle for hours at a time is kind of getting to me. I know what work I have to do, but it's repetitive and boring. I'm also tired, because I woke up at 6 am.</p>
            <p>I have to come up with a good summer schedule. I need to get to the NRL early to minimize time wasted in traffic, but I don't want to wake up so early that I'll be tired for the entire day. I want to try to leave by 6:30 every day, but that will mean packing lunch and eating breakfast will be tricky unless I wake up before 6.</p>
            <p>Honestly, SEAP isn't so bad though. Of course, its magnitudes better than what I did last summer. I also got a ton of cool stuff from Saxman One - a nice backpack that I'm daily driving, a notebook, hand sanitizer, a water bottle, and more.</p>
            <p>I also can't forget to fill out the rec letter form for Babs. If I'm being real, I was kind of disappointed that she didn't want to write a rec letter from scratch like she did for SEAP, but oh well. It makes sense if she wants to treat everyone equally, but I still think that I stood out from all of her other students, even if that's a bit self-centered.</p>

            <p>It's my second week as a SEAP intern, and right now, I'm bored as heck. And tired, too. I get seven hours every night and try to sleep before 11, but for some reason, I'm never fully awake during the day. This isn't good, especially because I have to drive every day. On Friday, I began dozing off behind the wheel and almost swerved into the lane next to me. Thank goodness I didn't crash into anyone. I bet everyone watching thought I was drunk, though.</p>
            <p>Completely irrelevant, but I've had some decent drama going on in my life. I never expected it would happen, but it kind of materialized out of nowhere. First, Jasmine asked me to go to a Peach Tree Rascals concert with her last month. I spent a week listening only to Peach Tree Rascals, and the concert was actually really fun. Then, at Stockholm, I became close friends with 5 other people and we hung out a lot. It was super fun talking and eating with each other. We even went on a hike together - Alaina came up the idea, and I found trails nearby and we went to a nearby mountain. It was super cool - I should write more about Stockholm another time. Anyways, the Alaina person called me a stud and asked me to go to NYC with her. I first said no because I have work, but Jamie and my mother booked a trip to New York to see a Broadway show just so that I could see Alaina, and now I'm meeting up with her ten days from now. Oh, and apparently Indra liked me when I was a freshman, and Jamie thinks she likes me now too. She seems kind of inquisitive when I talk to her about Jasmine and Alaina - I just really want advice - and I'm not sure how things will be from now on. </p>
            <p>About Stockholm, the trip was actually super fun. I mostly read on my e-reader and listened to music during the flight, so it was pretty chill. When we got there, the weather was also pretty good - a few degrees cooler, and a lot less humid. The event was held at the Colorado School of Mines, which isn't really a famous school, but the campus was new and everything was super clean. The coaches were really nice too. The food was okay - we could eat as much as we wanted from the food court - but it wasn't particularly good, mostly just fried American food. As for the competition, we didn't win, but that was expected since the other projects were so good.</p>
            <p>But the best part about Stockholm was the people. The first friend I made was a guy named Remington from Pennsylvania, and both of us are really into scioly. He's a captain of his team and they do decent at States every year, so we talked about strategies and invitationals we went to. We'll actually see each other at Princeton next year, which is pretty cool. Next, I became friends with Alaina - it was kind of weird because she just started talking to me a lot, and before long I was in her friend group with Gracelynne, who's going to Harvard, and Dylan, who's going to Rice. Both of them drink a lot, which is concerning, but they're both super nice and smart. Gracelynne qualified for AIME 4 times and Dylan is cracked at fencing and won awards at ISEF. I also became friends with Krishnam, who's from Utah and likes reading as much as I do, and Justin, who's actually crazy because he won 1st place at ISEF and got the Gordon E. Moore Award of $50,000 for his Stockholm project. I was really surprised he didn't win Stockholm given how well he did at ISEF. I searched him up on Reddit, and one post about him in a subreddit with 20 million members is the top post this entire year, with 50k upvotes.</p>
            <p>The seven of us, along with Jiaming, who's from Oregon (super chill guy) went hiking in Golden, Colorado, the place we were staying. It was really cool because we could see the small town nestled between two mountain ranges, one of which we were on. We took some nice photos too. And also, we're all pretty literate and do a lot of reading, and Alaina and I got everyone into Three Body Problem. I actually made a website with my personal books and our group's reading list, which everyone liked a lot.</p>
            <p>Lol it's funny how I'm in a room with two other interns, and both seem as interested in what they are doing as I am. The guy behind me is a sophomore in college, and we were picking at our hair at the exact same time.</p>

            <p>AP scores come out tomorrow. I'm so stressed - if the worst happens, which I'm kind of expecting, I'll get 4s for Chem and Calc and 3s for APUSH and Lang. I really should have prepared more for those tests - not because I would have done better on the exams, but because I would've felt better while waiting for my scores. Oh well. At least I only have to wait about 10 hours before I check them tomorrow morning.</p>
            <p>I'm starting to feel stressed again, and it's definitely a good thing. I feel more focused and organized now, and I have a sudden, strong desire to quit slacking. I sent out a message in the States chat and organized Codebusters grind for the summer.</p>
            <p>I know they're completely unrelated things, but I had a conversation with James today, and I think the things that I heard kind of shocked me out of my languishing. I know it'll sound really weird after I write it down, but I want to put it down anyway. James is working at a vertical farm this summer, and after we visited, we met up at Manoa Cafe to get food and chill. Jamie, James, and I sat together at a table and basically spilled tea for an hour. When James began spilling his tea about who he liked in high school, he listed off like 10 or so people, and the most recent one was Morgan. I predicted this correctly, but what surprised me was James's reason for not being really into Morgan. Apparently, she lost her virginity while dating Austin. After hearing that, I was completely appalled. But James went on to describe other people who had sex in our school - like Oliver, whom he described as  a "repeated offender," and more. I was shocked out of my mind. In the two years I knew Morgan, I thought her to be innocent and naive, and I thought Oliver was just a chill gamer who played Elden Ring for 10 hours a day. I guess both are still true; Morgan was probably coerced and Oliver still games a lot, but I didn't know how these people, who I thought were sensible and were making futures for themselves, had gone so low. I was especially disgusted with Austin - how could he have done such a thing, and why had I given him my sympathies and consideration for so many years? I was horrified.</p>
            <p>My negative reaction towards this information was completely my fault. I'm too much of an idealist, and that's why I found this lack of sexual hygiene revolting. I know I can't harshly judge other teenagers who have their own thoughts and hormones, but I'm still sickened by this.</p>
            <p>Again, this seems completely irrelevant to the talk with James, but I came to realize after hearing everything that I had to be better - I am above them, and I have to ensure that. When I got home, I wanted to clear my head, and I ran four miles. I ran at a 7 minute pace, so it was pretty good, too.</p>
            <p>I still don't know how to feel. My perception of everyone has changed - I think I lost a bit of respect for everyone. I also seriously reconsidered my innocence and idealism today.</p>
            <p>To top it off, Jamie told me what Elaina thought of me today. Apparently, she doesn't really like me - one, because I said she would just sub in for Scrambler at Regionals but she ended up making the entire build, and two, because I said I didn't receive her contact info even though she sent them. Understandable - I completely see why she could be annoyed at me. This shows that I have to be far better than what I am now. I'm so disappointed in myself.</p>
            <p>This is becoming a series of tangents now, but Alaina canceled on the NYC trip. I'm not too disappointed - I definitely looked forward to the trip, but I was expecting her to dip, because she's in Stanford right now for a paid summer program. She said she'll try to arrange something with Dylan and Gracelynne, but I don't know if I want to go. I probably will though if it happens, since Dylan and Gracelynne are pretty great.</p>
            <p>One good thing though - I spent more time with Jasmine, and things are going pretty well. The Peach Tree Rascals concert was great, and now I listen to them basically every day. The intro / starter (not sure what it's called) was also really good - an indie artist named FIG who I listen to a lot now as well. We also got together for the 4th of July; her mom works at the World Bank in DC, so she got us access to the balcony and we could see the fireworks at the National Mall from there. The fireworks weren't incredible, but it was great talking to her. The fireworks ended at 9:30 but we talked for another hour on the railing, just the two of us on the roof of the building. It felt really fulfilling, getting to know her better. I felt more natural talking to her that night, and I have a growing respect for her intelligence and maturity. She knows what she's doing, and she's really strong willed. Anyways, I got back home past 12 because we had to take the Metro and on the drive home I took a wrong turn. Maybe we'll meet again sometime after she comes back from her research program in San Diego. Jamie says the concert and the 4th of July were dates and that she's into me, but I'm not sure. I don't know how to feel about anyone around me. Except Jamie and my friends like James - they're the real ones.</p>

            <p>I'm writing at work again. I know I shouldn't really be doing this, but by the time I get past lunch it's so boring and sleep-inducing that I have to do something different.</p>
            <p>Like I said, I don't really find my work interesting. Dr. Oh asked me if my work was "fun", and I just said yes out of politeness. It's the topic of the work, not the work itself, that bores me; I like looking at the big picture and working with things that matter to a lot of people, but staring at ice crystals through a microscope doesn't seem that significant. Sure, the properties of microscopic elements govern the dynamics of all large aspects of life, but the scope just feels too narrow for me. I want to deal with the climate system and environmental dynamics, not tiny particles in a lab.</p>
            <p>It's not terrible work, though. I get paid, the people are super nice, and the commute isn't too long. But the things I'm working on don't feel so <i>big</i>.</p>
            <p>I also found a good topic for my personal statement yesterday. It needs refining, of course, and there are two completely different ways I can write about it. But I think it's the main answer I've been looking for, I can probably start writing today.</p>

            <p>One thing that's funny is how much music I've been listening to. I just put my liked songs on shuffle and listen to them over and over again. I probably get like 5 or 6 hours every day, which definitely isn't good for my ears, but it helps the time pass. Also, the college sophomore guy who works behind me always plays with his black stress ball. It's kind of goofy because he drops it sometimes and he even pulled it out from below my desk once.</p>
            <p>I wrote this before lunch, but I forgot to add a timestamp and now I'll be leaving soon. I walked all the way to the CAC office and back to get my email encryption certification, and now I'm all sweaty and tired.</p>

I work for 4 or 5 hours straight in the morning, but I only have 2 or 3 hours before I go after I eat lunch. Yesterday, I was so exhausted while watching Dr. Oh collect ice crystal measurements that I nearly fell asleep in front of her.</p>

            <p>My mother and my sister and I visited New York City this weekend. We watched the Great Gatsby in Broadway and visited the American Museum of Natural History. It was fun, but also tiring. I had to figure out how to get around everywhere, but the subway was surprisingly easy to navigate. We traveled by Amtrak, which was a first. I actually liked going by train because we didn't have to deal with going through security. The trip took three hours, which was longer than it would have been by plane, of course, but it didn't feel too long. The train was fast, traveling at 120 miles per hour, but we were able to see the scenery outside, which was mostly just trees. We passed some really dilapidated houses and impoverished neighborhoods - old, saggy groups of houses that weren't close to anywhere - and I was grateful for having everything in my life.</p>
            <p>The best part of the trip was walking around NYC. On Saturday, after the musical, we went to Chelsea and the riverside at 57th street and strolled around. It was a lot cleaner and less dense there compared to the rest of the city. We had dinner in the Chelsea Market, and I got to try currywurst for the first time, and it was really good.</p>
            <p>The Great Gatsby musical was a bit of a disappointment because it was so different from the book and didn't have any meaning. They slimmed down the book into three hours of entertainment; a lot of details, like Jordan and Nick getting engaged, were pretty pointless and just for show. I haven't watched that many more musicals, but compared to Hamilton (and the original book, of course) it felt really shallow. At least the actor for Nick Carraway was super talented and funny.</p>
            <p>The train on the way back was at 4 AM but my mother mistook it to be at 4 PM so we missed the original train and went back by bus. It took two more hours but we still got back home in time.</p>

            <p>I've been decently productive at work today. Not exactly productive, since I've just been fiddling around with a console output container for my app, but I haven't been distracted too much. I'm surprised I haven't fallen asleep yet.</p>
            <p>I don't know why I'm so tired during the day. I worry that it's a medical condition - it could be thyroid cancer, since my mother had it, malnutrition, since I don't eat too much protein and meat, or something else. Maybe it's just dehydration, but I make sure to drink a reasonable amount every day. And I drink tons of water whenever I get thirsty. Sleep shouldn't be the issue, because I get 6 to 7 hours consistently. Actually, how I exercise might be the problem; I go on intensive runs too close to bedtime, around 8 or 9, and that doesn't help me fall asleep. Maybe that's causing my sleep quality to deteriorate and make me tired during the day right from the moment I wake up. I'll try exercising earlier once the weather becomes more reasonable - right now it's 100 degrees, probably unsafe to run even a mile in the sun.</p>

            <p>I woke up an hour late today and left for work at 7:15. The traffic wasn't too bad, since I got there in 23 minutes, a record. Usually I'm held back by congestion near the last exit, but this time there was none. It was still bad that I was late though, because I'll be staying a little longer today. I also skipped breakfast, so I'm pretty hungry. Right now, I'm debating whether to eat my lunch now and buy lunch again later in the day. I'd be eating my brunch (?) pretty late so it might not be worth getting another lunch, but then again my sandwiches are pretty small. Apparently there's a Subway on campus, but I haven't been there and I'm not completely sure where it is.</p>
            <p>I still don't know why I'm so tired during the day. It prevents me from doing any meaningful work when I get home, which is bad because I really need to start working on my Common App essay. I have the idea there, it's just that I haven't gotten around to putting it into words.</p>
            <p>I need to work on the plan for tomorrow's scioly meeting. If I get bored anytime during work today, I'll work on that and the roadmap for next year.</p>

            <p>Jasmine hasn't been talking to me much recently, so I was getting kind of concerned. At one point I started wondering if I shouldn't have reposted Alaina's story, which was a video from Stockholm that I was in. Yesterday, Jasmine added a picture of some food to her story, and like an idiot, I asked if it was pesto. I know, it was super random and such a silly thing to say. Stupid stupid. But she responded, which was surprising. I'll text back when I get home, since the service here is really bad. I don't know if it's an intentional thing, but the reception in my building is garbage. The front of the NRL facility has fast 5G data, but when I get to Building A50, the reception is 1 bar at 4G or none at all.</p>
            <p>Unrelated, but there's something that's been on my mind recently. I have to think about it and reach a conclusion so I can possibly write about it for my college apps. The thing is, I'm not sure what I think of my father. I feel indebted to him, and yet I'm repelled by him. Earlier this month when I came back from watching fireworks with Jasmine, my father told me "you won't go to things ever again." My first instinct, without any thinking, was to respond with "yes, okay," which I immediately regretted and wished I hadn't said. And a few days ago, when my mother got her new car and my father said that my mother's car would be mine, I instantly responded by saying I didn't need her car and would be fine driving my father's car. Why had I been so willing to comply with his demands? Why was my immediate response to be yielding to him, to offer more to him? But in both cases, I ended up taking back what I said, because I genuinely wanted to go out and  have fun outside of the house and drive my mother's car. I can't figure out why I feel in debt to my father and ask more from him at the same time. I think this disparity will become more severe in the next few years - I'll be asking for more freedom, I'll be going to college on their checkbooks, I'll be getting jobs, and coming back in the summers to live with them. I'm looking for the answer to this question, and as I write my essays, I hope I'll find it.</p>

            <p>I finally got around drafting my personal statement. I did it in like 30 minutes when I was at a library yesterday. It wasn't perfect, of course, but writing it was surprisingly easy and the result was kind of good. I'm not sure if the format detracts from it, and I'm still thinking about a number of details I might edit, but otherwise, it wasn't terrible. I showed Indra and she really liked it, so I guess it's a good sign.</p>
            <p>I feel like I'm in a trance in the moments where I am tired. My consciousness deteriorates, and I have a subconscious level of awareness, but nothing clear enough that I can remember what I was experiencing or feeling. I'm just there, basically lifeless. When I do something in a trance of tiredness, it's without any conscious cognition and pure reaction - for example, switching tabs so I'm not doing something I shouldn't be doing, or sitting up straight when I have my head down. I can't control when I'm entering or exiting the trancelike state. The closest I can remember going into a trance of tiredness is knowing that I'm pretty tired and that I might fall asleep soon, but the next moment I'm fully conscious, I'm completely awake and realizing that I was half-sleeping a moment ago.</p>
            <p>I guess it's a little like sleepwalking. Jasmine described sleepwalking as a dream where what you do actually what happens, except you don't remember it. In my opinion, that's super scary because what if I did random things in my sleep and didn't even realize it? What if I've been sleepwalking at night this entire time, going downstairs, using my computer, and walking around? Of course it's basically impossible, but the fact that it happens to some people is disconcerting to me.</p>

            <p>We have a dish we use exclusively for fruit. It's nothing special, just a regular dinner plate. It had an imprint of a fruit, a persimmon or a tomato that's so faded it's orange. We always put apples or whatever fruit we were eating on it, but my dad dropped it yesterday so it's gone. It was kind of sad seeing it go, the scratched, faded old thing.</p>
            <p>I don't think I'm a very materialistic person. I can't think of any objects that I'm particularly bonded to. The only ones that might qualify are things I use every day, like my laptop, wallet, or phone, but I wouldn't be terribly sad if I lost them all of a sudden. The most valuable things I've worked on are all in the cloud - documents or GitHub repositories that can't be deleted. If someone takes everything physical from me, I'll still have my code and scioly documents in the cloud.</p>
            <p>I don't think I'd be sad if I lost all of my pictures, too. In the moment I'm taking them, I feel like they'll be cherished and remembered, but I hardly recall them and use them only once in a while, when I need a face shot for a bio or something.</p>

            <p>We're leaving for a camping trip this weekend. I'm pretty excited, because we're going to Kiptopeke, where I've wanted to go again for a long time. But the thing is, we're so unprepared - our food and sleeping mattresses are ready because I took them out of the shed, but otherwise, we haven't packed much else. I think we'll spend like an hour after I get home just packing random things that we'll need on the trip. It's basically only a day though, since we're leaving Sunday morning, so I suppose we won't need too many things.</p>
            <p>This probably isn't important, but Indra asked me the day before yesterday whether I was still talking to Katie. I just thought it was so funny and random that she asked that. I answered no, because I've been ghosting her (and feel kind of bad about it), but when I asked her why she asked that, she just said "I forgot" which isn't that good of a reason.</p>
            <p>At night, I've been reading J. D. Vance's <i>Hillbilly Elegy</i>, and it's fascinating. Of course I think Vance is a wacko and a hypocrite, but I wanted to consider the perspective of people with views contrary to my own. I also wanted to understand how the singular book had propelled Vance to national stardom. I have to admit, it's decent writing, and Vance blends his experiences and opinions in a way that's really compelling. I think he overgeneralizes here and there, but his unbiased observations are really thought-provoking. Reading his book, I feel so fortunate that I live where I do and have all the opportunities around me. Sure, my friends and I might complain that Woodson is terrible and that high schools in the north and California are better, but Fairfax is so high-income and so well-educated compared to the vast majority of the country, so it's hard not to feel at least some gratitude for our current situation.</p>

I was able to do some (really basic and janky) time series analysis, so all I have left is adding a few features, tidying up the GUI, and improving the object detection algorithm. Preparing for the presentation this Thursday and writing my part of the paper for publication will be a bit of a hassle, but I think I'll manage.</p>
            <p>The book I'm currently reading is Noah Yuval Harari's <i>Sapiens</i>. Like the critics say, there's little information that's groundbreaking, but the general theories and connecting ideas that Harari delivers are really unique and eye-opening. We expect humans to act in certain ways, and there are so many things that are "unnatural" for us, but in reality, nothing is "unnatural" - we just deem them to be, and they're an assumed reality. If we chisel the essence of humanity down to its biological barebones, there's so much that humans can do, and so much that can be done to humans. Our culture and false notions are our blindfolds of comfort.</p>

            <p>Another three weeks has gone by since I last wrote in my journal. Actually, it's the first entry I've written since the first day of school. So much has happened again, and even when I take breaks after school or during the weekend, time still seems to be getting faster. I read on Reddit that life just keeps getting faster and faster... I wonder if the years will feel like months, and the months like days, when I'm past twenty or thirty. That is, if I make it that far. Not going to lie, I'm somewhat skeptical that I'll make it past my early twenties. It's probably because it's hard for me to imagine life beyond college, but still - it feels strange having no idea what I'll be doing in five or ten years.</p>
            <p>But back to the present. All of my teachers are pretty good this year; Hedrick is exceptional, and Blevins, Sargent, and Oberle are great in their own ways. Galitzer and Hoefer aren't particularly interesting, but it's not like I have options (in the case of Multivar) and they're not too tense. It's kind of early in the year to judge, but I think Mr. Hedrick is the best teacher I've had before, ever. He communicates concepts to clearly, and each of his lessons feel so relevant and worth listening to. A lot of the stuff I learn in government is review, but when Mr. Hedrick teaches it, every moment feels productive and engaging. Mr. Hedrick and I kind of think similarly, too - he's really efficient and wants to get things done.</p>
            <p>Right now, my grades are okay, but I'll need to brush them up soon. I made simple errors on some easy assignments, so my grade in APES might go down. I also bombed an AP Physics quiz - I was so stupid, and for both FRQs, I was so close to solving them correctly, but I was an actual imbecile and made some dumb errors. I also had my Multivar test today, and it wasn't bad, but I definitely could have studied more. Also, I'm pretty sure I put 2.354 instead of 2.353 for the bonus, so I'll be pretty sad if I don't get the extra credit.</p>
            <p>Quite a lot has happened outside of school, too. My paper got accepted for publication and presentation at MIT URTC, which is nice. I got rejected from Caltech Up Close, which was pretty depressing. Special Olympics has started again, but Zach and Hudson, our two best and biggest athletes, both broke their arms and will be unavailable this season, which is really bad. Scioly is also off to a pretty rough start, because I spoke too fast at the interest meeting and we didn't do enough advertising.</p>
            <p>As for Jasmine... I'm not sure how things got to be as they are now. She asked me to hang our with her and Phoebe this Monday and go on a hike at Scott's Run. The three of us got on a rock near the waterfall, and we just talked for three hours. When we finally got back, we had Andy's pizza, which was really good (I wish I had eaten some more). I was lowkey thinking Jasmine and Phoebe were bored because they kept talking each other, but after Phoebe left, we chatted one on one for another hour and it was pretty chill.</p>
            <p>I finally got up to go at 8:30 because I had a scioly meeting at nine. When I started walking out the door, I noticed aloud how dark it was outside. But before I could go any further, Jasmine stopped me.</p>
            <p>"Hey, can I ask you something real quick?" she said.</p>
            <p>"Sure," I said, not knowing what to expect.</p>
            <p>She said some other things before asking me the question: "Do you want to go to homecoming with me?"</p>
            <p>I paused for a moment. I had realized it before, but I realized it again: how everything Jasmine did was so well-planned and thought out. She chose the Peach Tree Rascals concert because it was small and didn't have a people, perfect for a first hangout; she told her mom and brother to leave the World Bank balcony early so we could talk for another hour at night; and she waited for me to go to the door, when I couldn't really see her face, nor she mine. I could barely make out something like a smile on her face as I teetered on the edge of her doorstep.</p>
            <p>More thoughts flashed across my mind. I thought about Indra, how I was considering asking her to go to hoco with me, or even more. I thought about the plans Jamie had made for hoco, and how I had invited Jamie. I thought about all the new people I'd meet if I went with Jasmine, from Langley and TJ and wherever. At that moment, I came to the conclusion that it was too risky - there were too many variables - for me to give a firm yes. But I didn't want to make her feel bad outright. After all, we had spent time together, and she had planned so much on her part.</p>
            <p>"Probably..." I said. "When is it?"</p>
            <p>"I'm not sure if you're available, but it's on September 28th. I can give you a full list of people too-"</p>
            <p>"Oh, I probably want to go - I'll take a look at my calendar, but I'll probably go with you!"</p>
            <p>And then I waved, and left, walking past her house. I crossed the road, and the first thing I did was call Indra.</p>
            <p>"Hello? Indra, can you hear me?"</p>
            <p>A murmured "Andrew what is going on" echoed from my speakers.</p>
            <p>"Indra, am I cooked? Can you hear me? I'm not sure I can hear you well."</p>
            <p>"Yes, I can hear you Andrew."</p>
            <p>"Indra, help me! My TJ friend asked me to go to hoco. What do I do?"</p>
            <p>"Do you want to go with her, Andrew?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know. Indra, am I cooked?"</p>
            <p>"Andrew, do you want to go with her?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know. I told her probably, but I'm really not sure."</p>
            <p>"Wow, Andrew. Did you tell her what you really feel about her?"</p>
            <p>"No, I didn't."</p>
            <p>"Andrew, really have to tell her what you feel about her. Or else she might get hurt or mad."</p>
            <p>"Okay, I know. I'll text you later."</p>
            <p>"Okay."</p>
            <p>I got to my car, heart racing, and drove home. I told Jamie, and she screamed a little and told me that I had to go. For rest of the night, that was the only thing on my mind. In the span of 24 hours, I tried to consider everything I had felt about Indra and Jasmine up to that point.</p>
            <p>I've felt an attraction to Indra since the first time I met her. Not necessarily romantically, but just as a person. In 3rd grade, I was drawn to her at recess and always tried talking to her; in freshman year, I chatted with her all the time and gave her a Christmas gift; and during the last three years, I always helped her with schoolwork. I even did her APCSA final project for her. I weas never romantically attracted to her, but I started reconsidering this year. We had half our classes together when the year started - Multivar, Lit, Physics, and Gov - but even after she switched to online Physics and Gov, we sit next to each other in Multivar and chat or goof off during class. It was this year that she started acting differently - touching me slightly, with her elbow, finger, or pencil, or just bringing up all the guy she talked about. She also asked about the other girls I hung out with, and Jamie speculated that she was interested in me.</p>
            <p>Laying in bed Monday night, I realized that I definitely was attracted to Indra, in the slightest sense. I found her presence comforting; she warmed my heart a little, because we could converse to honestly and have so much fun. I almost wanted to take it a step further. I felt something I had never felt before - I wanted to close the gap between us, to have her in my arms and her head on my shoulder. It's not that I find her physically attractive - she's definitely unique, but I've never been drawn in by someone's appearance. But for some reason, I knew that I liked how I could provide something to Indra, and I wanted to provide something more - comfort, warmth, and maybe even intimacy.</p>
            <p>I nearly resolved to call off hoco, say something to Indra directly, and maybe do something for our own hoco. But I didn't, because I had given Jasmine my word, albeit uncertain, and she had spent her own time with me. So I waited until the next day.</p>
            <p>In school, I told Indra again that I didn't expect to go to hoco, that I had no urge to go. But as I got home, I realized that becoming something more with Indra wasn't all that easy. She was still a person, not just a warm doll I could hold in my arms. She came with all the baggage of a normal person, and I knew that in her case, she would ask a lot of me.</p>
            <p>I decided, then, that I would to go homecoming with Jasmine. It didn't matter that I felt some attraction to Indra. I hadn't been considering the time Jasmine and I spent together, what she might feel about me, and what I might feel about her. I had been closing off my thoughts about her beacuse of Indra, but I knew deep down that she was a wonderful and fascinating person. After all, I told Indra directly that she was one of the coolest people I've known in my life.</p>
            <p>I thought about it more, and deduced that Jasmine is a better person in a number of ways. She's extremely independent, direct, and even ambitious. While Indra is always unsure of what to do, Jasmine always has initiative and knows what she wants. Indra told me that for a man to be attracted to a woman, he must want to protect her, but I realized that I didn't feel that for Indra, or at least not strongly enough. Nor did I for Jasmine, at least not yet. But either way, I didn't want to be with someone who expected everything of me. On the other hand, the way Jasmine takes care of herself and works to get whatever she wants is so refreshing.</p>
            <p>At seven on Monday, I texted Jasmine that I would love to go to hoco with her. I'm still not sure what she feels about me, but I've opened my eyes and heart. It's time for me, too, to decide what I feel about spending time with her.</p>
            <p>Today during lunch, Indra was sleeping in Mrs. Babcock's room while I was studying. She had her hood down, so I could only see her mouth and nose. I stared at her for a full minute and began thinking what it would like to be closer to her now. But deep down, I knew that I didn't want to be with someone like her, at least for the first girl I'll have feelings for. I don't know what love is, and I'm not sure when I'll feel it and for whom, but I know that if I want to spend time with a girl, it'll be with someone who can take care of herself and has full confidence in herself.</p>

            <p>I'm only writing this down because I don't want to forget, but Babs told Jamie something during the interest meeting. After I had spoken too fast during the presentation, she told Jamie that I should have talked too fast, and that I should have smiled more. "If Andrew smiled, all the girls would go ahh~!" She said. (Or, at least according to Jamie's impression of her.)</p>
            <p>I'm not sure what to say to that... I don't know whether to be more surprised about how she had such thoughts in the first place, or how she told Jamie something like that. Either way, it's not like anyone can have my smile.</p>

            <p>When Jasmine told me who would be at TJ hoco, she said it would just be her friends and their dates. That mean's that I'm her date, and I hers. Now that's a first.</p>
            <p>According to Jamie, Matthew said that I was his favorite person in scioly. Apparently, she asked him who his favorite person in scioly was, expecting him to say Ivy, but he said me instead. "He's easiest to work with," he said. Well, that was heartwarming. I always felt bad because I became President instead of him; he probably thought he had secured the position since freshman year, when he was on States and objectively the best person in our grade. But I toiled and schemed my way to the presidency, leaving Matthew in the dust. We were still close after I became president; partly because we competed and studied together, but mostly because we liked each other's presence and thought really similarly. I don't know, it just warms my heart. I'm so fortunate to have friends like Matthew.</p>
            <p>Jasmine mentioned that she had a bucket list, and I said I would make it, so I should get on with it.</p>

                <p class="timestamp">Tuesday 9.26.2023 10:27 EST</p>
                <p>I've never liked sleeping a lot. I'm often stuck in a cycle where I lose sleep, regret losing it, indulge in it, and regret indulging in it, which leads me to lose more sleep all over again. </p>
                <p>Recently, I started tracking my sleep patterns on my watch, and I have to admit it's been motivating me to improve the quality of my sleep. I try to sleep before 11 PM and get 8 hours of rest; I've also begun to wake up at 6:30 every day. Of course, 6:30 isn't ideal but it's a lot better than before, when I was filthily lazy in the mornings. The first thing I do when I get up is check my watch, because for some reason it fascinates me to see how many hours of sleep I got. I guess my watch has made sleeping into a productive activity, which has improved my regard for it. </p>
                <p>One weird thing about my sleeping habits is that I don't sleep with a pillow. At one point in the past year or two, I wondered why literally everyone slept with a pillow. I knew that the Ancient Egyptians used wooden headrests while sleeping, but I can't figure out why people today had to follow them and put something under their heads while in bed. After that thought, I never considered pillows to be comfortable again.</p>
                <p>This improved the quality of my sleep profoundly. But I still haven't been able to dream regularly. The last significant dream I had was before the AP World History test on the night of May 10th, 2023. I dreamed that the Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) and Short Answer Question (SAQ) sections were merged and I spent too much time on the MCQs, leaving me no time for the SAQs. In reality, I did well on the MCQ and SAQ but did terribly on the Free Response Questions (FRQs). How unproductive of a dream.</p>
                <p>My neck is hurting now and I want to return to my bed. But I have an AP Chemistry quiz tomorrow and some AP US History work to do, so I'll linger for a bit before I go up. </p>

                <div class="entry-title">Entry: Costco</div>
                <p class="timestamp">Tuesday 9.26.2023 10:25 PM EST</p>
                <p>One time, when I was perhaps 6 years old, my family went to a Costco warehouse when we were on a road trip. We visited Costco often, and still do today. But since this branch wasn't a one I had visited before, I didn't know the layout and got lost. I walked between the towering pallets, bewildered by the goods that were stacked high above me. Only moments ago had I been within a safe radius of my parents; now I was alone and meandering. </p>
                <p>I was frightened and didn't know what to do. All of a sudden, all that had meant much to me was nowhere in sight, and the once-familiar stacks of canned and packaged food were formidable and unwelcoming. The absence of three people for just a moment had augmented my thoughts. </p>
                <p>Eventually, a staffer found me loitering in an empty aisle, and taking a quick look around, found my parents just around the corner. But now, years later, that feeling of getting lost hasn't gone away. </p>

                <div class="entry-title">Entry: Potbelly Cravings</div>
                <p class="timestamp">Wednesday 9.27.2023 11:02 pm EST</p>
                <p>The States team is having a meeting to create the teams for this year, and we'll all be eating Potbelly. My favorite restaurant chain is Potbelly by a long shot. I've always been disappointed by the low quality of Subway sandwiches because they have so little meat and every sandwich tastes the same. But each Potbelly sandwich type has a different character, and whatever you order, you always get enough filling, so you're never left unsatisfied. I can't recall the exact scenario where I first ordered a Potbelly sandwich, but I do recall being immensely pleased with how good it tasted and how filling it was.</p>
                <p>It's crazy how I've been thinking about a sandwich this entire week. I settled on an original Steakhouse Beef with mayo, extra lettuce, extra onions, extra tomatoes, cucumbers, artichoke hearts, and probably a few more things. I knew I'd feel hungry while placing my order, but ordering 7 other sandwiches was too cruel to my empty stomach. </p>
                <p>I wonder why some people view my management of our Science Olympiad team as questionable. Actually, they don't question my choices, they just complain about how I make those choices. It's not even complaining, either - they just talk amongst themselves and I find out through Jamie. I don't think I try to be overbearing, and I definitely don't make all the decisions by myself, since I'm constantly discussing things with Sophia, Zahra, and Mrs. Babcock. Honestly, I'd blame it on the incompetent Sophomores who are annoyed about Jamie, who they view as having more opportunities. It infuriates me how they're the same people supporting Ivy and telling her tryouts test contents and structures along with her performance rankings, which I explicitly stated that they should remain private. </p>
                <p>But then again, I've been questioning decisions I've made recently, and with good reason. It's not that I'm remorseful, it's just that I may be toeing the line for what I should and should not be doing as a leader of the team. So I guess those naysayers are in the same boat as I am. </p>
                <p>Man, I am so hungry right now. I would eat my calculus textbook if I didn't have to study for a quiz tomorrow.</p>

                <div class="entry-title">Entry: Freedom and Religion</div>
                <p class="timestamp">Monday 10.2.2023 10:13 PM EST</p>
                <p>At this moment, I am experiencing a period of freedom that occurs once a year. My parents are out of town right now because my mom's company, New York Life, holds councils across the world where they invite their best salespeople and have them celebrate together. Up to my Freshman year, my sister and I went to every council meeting. They were somewhat excessive, but at least the company provided us with all the food, lodging, and venues. When my mom performed well certain years and qualified to attend higher councils, the entertainment and activities would be better. During the Chairman's Council in October of 2021, our family stayed at a huge resort in Phoenix and ate very well. We got shipped around in tour buses to various locations, including museums and a horseback riding venue. The trips were fun, but now my sister and I are too busy to go along. Which is why the two of us are stuck here. </p>
                <p>It's a pity that I can't drive right now. This morning, I woke up at 7:20 AM after falling asleep twice, at 6:00 and 6:30. I had 15 minutes to pack my lunch, prepare my bag, and run to the bus stop. Waking up that late was my fault, and I paid the price today by being extremely tired. I was lucky to have prepared my lunch the night before. But despite our apparent lack of self-regulation, it's nice not having my mother and father around. I have to manage a lot of things by myself; I mowed and trimmed the lawn, cooked, and did the laundry. But I feel more productive and self-directed without them here. </p>
                <p>Totally irrelevant, but I've been thinking about religion at times recently. Not too deeply, but from time to time. I'm a strong atheist, and I believe that there could be no higher power that controls us. Religion, resultant of humanity's desire for developing social hierarchies and shielding ignorance with the supernatural, is no more factual than the Dickens book on my desk right now. My feelings for religion border on condescension. But religion has its impacts on everyone. </p>
                <p>About a month ago, I was talking with Harun about his religious beliefs. Being a Muslim, he said that he distances himself from his background's religious standards that can be viewed as racist or sexist. In other words, he had the mind to be critical of the faith he was reared in. I was inspired, and commended him for his progressive thinking. </p>
                <p>Not long after, I was meeting with Jamie's friends in a meeting room in the City of Fairfax Public Library. One of them, Brian, was a Muslim. While we were talking, he said that he would do his prayer, and Jamie hushed me so he could conduct his prayer in silence. That moment put religion in a new light for me. From my first impressions of Brian, he seemed a kind and honest kid. And even though I looked down on religion, seeing his genuine faith in his God inspired me. Even though just a child, Brian could dedicate his virtues and character to a God and a faith, and that he would go about his religious activities in the presence and potential criticism of his peers, was just shy of a revelation. I was very impressed. </p>
                <p>I think neither pious devotion nor endorsement of progress can be measures of one's moral and religious character - they can only be measured only in terms of respect. I found Harun virtuous because he respected his own forward-thinking beliefs that stepped away from his religious traditions, and he never discussed those thoughts with the intention to actively spread them. I found Brian virtuous because he respected his beliefs but never tried to impose them on others. As long as you're true to yourself and mindful of others, I guess religion can be just as good as the absence of it. </p>
                <p>But in many cases, religion is tainted and impure. While I was working on the lawn this Sunday, a Honda Accord drove up to our cul-de-sac and a late middle-aged Korean man stepped out. In Korean, he asked me if I was from Korea and gave me a pamphlet about their church. I didn't take a second look and put it aside, continuing to clear the driveway with my blower. The first man stepped back into the car and the driver started it, but after creeping forward for two yards, they stopped. I could tell they were watching me mow the lawn, and after around 10 minutes, the driver came out and began to talk to me. I lowered the setting on my blower before turning it off. </p>
                <p>The man introduced himself as the pastor of some church in Annandale (behing the 9292 restaurant) and began his spiel about God. I listened out of politeness, but I knew from the start what he was trying to do. He asked what grade I was in, what my name was, and whether I went to church. I answered his questions like an idiot, but I gave him my legally unrecognized Korean name and he understood my grade incorrectly. Either way, I won't respond at all when some guy like him comes up. But back to his spiel. He started off with a religious appeal, but seeing my lack of appreciation for his Presbyterian God, he switched to a personal appeal, saying God helps everyone. That didn't work either, so he talked about academics and college, saying God would follow me throughout my academic journey. Bullshit. I put on a disinterested look and he went away, but I was disappointed that I didn't send him off sooner. </p>
                <p>It is these religious followers I despise. I had a friend in 5th grade who tried to convert me to Catholicism, and that ruined my good regard for him. And that bastard pastor - he has some ego thinking he can go around converting every Joe and Jane. </p>
                <p>The license plate of the Accord was VYT-2107.</p>

                <p>I got 4 hours of sleep last night and the night before. I got 4 hours on Tuesday because I was finishing an essay for AP English Language and Composition, and I got 4 hours last night because I was studying for a Spanish exam I failed. It's not good that I'm sleeping this late considering my grades. I also crashed twice in school today - in Data Structures, where I took a 10 minute nap and couldn't see clearly for 20 minutes, and BC Calculus, where I missed two pages of notes.</p>
                <p>If I'm tired this early, I'm going to be a lot more tired in January and February. I'll have four Science Olympiad competitions in the first two months of 2024. Last year, I got 3 hours of sleep for 3-4 days a week for 3 months straight. Just thinking about those days makes me hurt inside.</p>

                <p>I shouldn't have stayed up late yesterday. According to my watch, I fell asleep at 11:56 PM. I should've gotten more considering how much I missed this week. I fell asleep during Mr. Sorenson's Physics lecture and I think I might fall asleep soon. </p>
                <p>I have changed so much in the past year. I am completely different from who I was before the year to the point that I cannot recognize my former self. I met new people, my academics improved and worsened, I matured and remained a child. I had many successes; I won medals, positions, and awards. I had many defeats; I didn't win awards, my paper got rejected, and I failed to succeed academically. I left a friend. I crashed my bike. I fell in love with a campus. I'm in the middle of losing my dream. And a year ago, I couldn't have seen any of these things happening to me, nor can I guess at what's ahead.</p>
                <p>Who knows what I'll be like next year?</p>

                <p>I have so much going on this week. I have scioly every day except for Friday, I have to winterize Canterbury's garden for enviro club on Tuesday, I have to do a lab for my CONRAD group, and I had a piano lesson until I canceled it. I have a calculus test on Wednesday that I want to ace. I also have a chem test both days of the week; the FRQ is tomorrow and the MCQ is on Friday. I'm actually glad that Mr. Raimondo split up the test because I don't need to study as much for the FRQ.</p>
                <p>Lavanya just asked what I was doing on my computer. I wonder how obvious it was that I wasn't coding something but typing out words. </p>

                <p>I don't know what's wrong with me. Every part of my body hurts, and has hurt since I can remember. My eyes, my back, my knees, my chest, my head. I assume everyone else experiences that pain too. At this point I don't know if they actually do. I also don't sleep early anymore - gone are the days where I slept at 9:30. I show up to school with 3 hours of sleep and nap through my classes. I also don't eat anymore and eat 1 meal, 2 meals a day at most. My skin is tautly stretched across my ribs and my stomach is a crevasse. I can't think straight and lose my train of thought in conversation. I used to eat six pounds of food a day, but not anymore. I'm sick now too, and I think that might be because of Morgan.</p>

                <p>George Winston's music is so sad. The way he articulates each note of his flowing melodies fills me with sorrow.</p>
                <p>I got my December SAT score back the day before yesterday. I'm not sure how to feel about it. On one hand, I'm happy and relieved because I had low expectations for my score. I didn't do that well for my first SAT in August and I hadn't prepared that much. I had also been really sleepy during the reading portion, so I felt like I had messed up on a few questions. On the other hand, the score isn't as high as I wanted even back in August. I got one more question wrong on the reading and one less question wrong on the writing, so I didn't actually improve; instead, the curve was a bit more favorable for me. I guess I'll never be satisfied until I get a 1600.</p>
                <p>At least my score is right on the 50th percentile for SAT Reading and Writing scores for MIT applicants. My math score was an 800 of course, but I still feel like my overall score could be better. I won't be taking the test again anytime soon, though. If I have time next summer, I'll take the August 2024 one and try to get a perfect score; if not, I'll apply with the score I got on Friday.</p>
                <p>I don't understand why people my age are attracted to one another. They claim to love each other and it means everything to them. Can't they see that everything is futile and petty? Years, months, or even weeks later, they'll look back and recall how childish they were and how they could have made better choices, how they could have spent their childhood doing better things. Nothing they feel now is permanent. In a matter of solar orbits, they'll have graduated college and found a job and be working Or maybe I'm just pretentious. Maybe I'm claiming to be the adult I'm supposed to be on the outside, yet it's just my inner child speaking. </p>

                <p>I'm studying in the library right now. I wasn't getting anything done at home so I decided to change things up a bit. I think I'm more focused now, but where I'm sitting, it's too bright to use my computer screen easily. The wall in front of me is entirely made of glass blocks. Too bad the Kings Park Public Library doesn't have a lot of good study spaces like the City of Fairfax Regional one does. </p>
                <p>I want to travel somewhere. I feel restless, working all day at home on schoolwork or Science Olympiad. I have progress in the material world, but I don't feel like I'm developing as a person. I want to go back to Alaska, to taste the fresh air and wade barefoot in the icy, blue-green streams. I want to see the snow-covered mountains and the evergreen forests, the broad rivers and the endless valleys. I want to go back to that bitter yet beautiful landscape, and let it kindle a fire inside of me with its magical immenseness. Thinking about that place makes me feel like I'm missing something.</p>

                <p>Things in my house are so messed up right now. My parents won't talk to each other at all and use me and my sister as intermediaries. Some things are easier now that my father doesn't talk to us in the presence of my mother, but it makes the household overall more tense. Yesterday my mother asked if I could ask my father when he would buy a new washing machine, since it's broken right now. I never imagined things would get this bad. In the next two years, I think they'll get a lot closer to divorcing. </p>

                <p>In the past two days (yesterday and today), I've written a thousand lines of code, coded at my desk for more than 16 hours, and run 4 miles. I could have been more productive but it's an improvement. I got absolutely nothing done in the past week. Actually, that hasn't changed for my academics - I have to pick up my Calculus and APUSH work again. And scioly - I have a lot of catching up to do for Detector, Fermi, and Robot.</p>
                <p>Note to self: change the root domain page (this page) to an about me and make this journal less accessible. I think I'll keep the digital rain aesthetic for the main page, though. It's grown on me quite a bit. Another note to self: use your headphones less. My ears are starting to hurt after playing music and using noise canceling so much recently.</p>

                <p>I got around restructuring my journal files. I don't know if my changes will prevent people from finding my journal. If someone already found my journal, then they'll know what they're looking for and could probably find it quickly. But I don't know if someone looking at the repo for the first time will locate this file easily. After all, they can just search for keywords in the repo.</p>
                <p>Winter break is drawing to a close, and I'm disappointed at how little I got done during this break. I was too stressed to do work, and now I have four days to do schoolwork, CONRAD, Science Fair, and Science Olympiad. I don't expect to sleep for a few days next week.</p>
                <p>Scioly is an embarrassment right now. First of all, Sophia hasn't talked with Zahra and me about the t-shirts at all. I asked Mrs. Babcock what the situation was but she hasn't responded either. If we don't order by next Tuesday, we'll be paying $180 for rapid 3-day shipping. I saw an Instagram post by VASO with questions from previous years and I thought they were questions for States this year and sent screenshots in States chat. I'm literally Vice President. I'm actively ruining myself. Also, the battery Matthew gave me for Robot Tour is dead so I can't test the code that I've optimized (well, I found how to optimize it but haven't written it out yet). I also don't have the 1.0 molar Copper (II) Sulfate solution I need for Detector Building to make a salt bridge.</p>
                <p>Was I too stressed to do work? Or am I incompetent? Either way, I have to spend the next four days effectively. That starts by going to sleep early today.</p>
                <p>Indra was the only person who contacted me this break. I think her "merry christmas" message made my day that day. I don't know what I'm doing, but my friends... I don't even know what's going on between me and my friends. When I ran into Harun at the library he was so formal. And James has been distancing himself from me and Jamie after our falling-out. As for Matthew and Indra, they've always been wonderful friends, but I don't know what to talk about with them. Have I ever known, though?</p>

                <p>The Fairfax Invitational was supposed to be tomorrow but it got canceled due to rain and snow. It won't even rain that much, yet the county canceled all school-related activities for the entire day. I was feeling pretty miserable already from not having slept at all last night, but the cancellation made me feel even worse. Fairfax was supposed to be the trial run before our important competitions... In my view, all of the study events worked much harder than they did in previous years. Katie managed Towers excellently, and all three teams for Air Trajectory and Flight did so much work over the break. I genuinely wanted to see how everyone's increased commitment would translate into performance, but that won't be happening now.</p>
                <p>Not all events were well-run, though. Optics and Wind Power are pretty tricky so all three teams had minimal preparation. But the worst by far was Scrambler. Enzo had to finish his college applications and only began working on his car yesterday. I was actually so mad because he could have sent me all the files to print over break, but he was stupid enough to not care about his own build on top of the Regional teams' build. </p>
                <p>That's probably enough for now. I should go to bed now, considering my <a href="../assets/fairfax-sleep.png" target="_blank">sleep log</a> for today. I slept for 10 minutes in Mrs. Babccok's room, the entirety of Data Structures, and most of Calculus. It was weird but also kind of funny how Mr. Kim would come to my side and ask me in Korean if I was okay because I had my head down for his entire lecture.</p>
                <p>Anyways, time to finish what I worked on at 4am yesterday and create some copper electrodes. My soldering iron will never see the end of me.</p>

                <p>Two days ago I tried to write about how I became Vice President of Woodson Science Olympiad. I did a pretty bad job, so I archived it for now.</p>
                <p>I've been listening to so much popular music nowadays that I've lost a bit of my classical music. I still listen to Jan Lisiecki's Chopin Etudes of course, but not much other classical music. But right now, I'm listening to classical piano, and it's absolutely wonderful. Actually, my Spotify began to play a flute sonata but I switched it back to piano. Anyways, listening to Clair de Lune made me think of how three years ago, I would relish in playing and listening to classical music more than anything else. I thoroughly mastered Chopin's Fantasie-Impromptu, the third movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, and Debussy's Claire de Lune. I long to go back and play those melodies, hearing the notes, my fingers manipulated by my mind to be delicate or powerful, intricate or explicit, sounding from the long strings of a pianoforte. But it's too late, as I've forgotten too much of the notes.</p>

                <p>It's funny how I'm writing again in the same class period exactly one week after my previous entry. I guess I feel particularly bored and unproductive during Mr. Sorenson's physics lectures.</p>
                <p>Today is the first day of school this week. There was no school on Monday because it was MLK day, and since it snowed 2 inches Monday night, Tuesday was canceled and we had a two-hour delay today.</p>

                <p>It happened - we canceled Carnegie. My hope began to fade last night, but today, I realized how dire the situation was - if anyone got hurt on the ride to Carnegie, which was very possible considering the snow, it would be on the conscience of me, Mrs. Babcock, and the club forever.</p>
                <p>This does ruin our ambitions for performance. Two in-person invitationals would have been so effective. But that won't happen, and our only option is to do another virtual invitational. I'm thinking about BirdSO, which is really competitive and will give us more experience than most satellites. </p>

                <p>I just finished my science fair paper with Jamie. In 4 hours. Starting from scratch. Not to brag, but I think that was a smashing hit. All we had was a Google Doc titled "Paper :DDD" at 8 PM and by 11:56 PM we had a fully fleshed, 8-page report with citations in Overleaf. I did make a mistake with the citations and submitted it with 2 minutes left, but we got the job done. I'm kind of happy all of our research was completely valid and the model I made was actually strong, unlike last year where we manufactured data.</p>
                <p>I was really mad on Thursday after I got home from school. When I was working in Mrs. Babcock's school, Heman stopped by for a bit and talked with some scioly people. I found out later through Harun, who messaged Jamie, that he literally roasted a bunch of people who were present there, including me, right in front of everyone he was talking about. He also claimed that his partner wasn't doing anything. I was fuming until today. How could a kid have such an ego and be so disrespectful? 10 times out of 10 I would take a student who tries hard and shows up to every meeting instead of some egomaniac who hasn't shown up to a single training session. I know I'm getting too mad about a freshman, but the moment I catch him spouting his pretentious thoughts I'll scold him in front of scioly so he doesn't try out again for next year. That kid also pulled down a fire alarm with his track friends. How disgraceful. I didn't think I would ever be ashamed to lead certain individuals in scioly, but here I am.</p>
                <p>I was also mad because when Harun, Shaheer, Brian, Ada, and Jamie and I were out in the snow after scioly, Harun called Jamie a bitch several times. I boiled inside but waited until I got home to reprimand him. I was still angry, though.</p>
                <p>Just before I went to sleep, I realized why I had been so mad. Earlier that day, we were distributing donuts people had bought for our fundraiser that had been meant to fund rooms for CMU. I've been working the most in scioly out of everyone, but I know I've left some loose ends here and there. So, it made sense when Mrs. Babcock said that I didn't have finesse when I was forcefully trying to open a donut box. I was fine then, but I think subconsciously I was enraged that I had failed to meet Mrs. Babcock's standards. I am the self-made President with an impeccable track record and headstrong leadership. I am supposed to lead out team to rank in the top 2 at States. Yet I didn't meet the level of what Mrs. Babcock thought I could do. That hurt, and it made me upset for the rest of the evening.</p>
                <p>My parents aren't talking still. Or, at least they don't talk with each other. They yell commands at each other or talk through me or Jamie, but otherwise they don't communicate whatsoever. When they do communicate indirectly, I feel a wave of stress. Things are still this bad; I think it will be for a while, probably for two years like my father is thinking.</p>

                <p>My AP Lang grade is so low right now. The possibility I don't end with an A is real, even likely. The same thing that happened in AP Stats last year might be happening again, except the other way around - grades so low for one semester that the other would have to be very close to 100 for my final grade to be a borderline A. It's really depressing and kind of demoralizing. But I'll try my best to raise my timed writing grades by working with Mr. Annear. I'll also do timed writing practices by myself, so I'm more prepared for the assessments.</p>
                <p>My other grades are mostly fine. I messed up on the fourth AP Chem test even though it was really easy, so my quarter grade is an A-. But my first quarter grade was high enough (95.4%) that my semester grade is still an A. Calculus is kind of a problem, but I know what to do now to raise my grade - I just need to study in advance for the 3rd quarter tests, and 4th quarter should be really easy. Otherwise, my grades are all above 99% - Data Structures and APUSH are so free. Actually, I take that back - I got 2 questions wrong for one Physics quiz and Mr. Sorenson hasn't updated my grades, so my quarter grade is a 93.8% right now but my first quarter was 99.6% so it'll be hard for me to screw up my semester grade.</p>
                <p>The Get2Green Action Plan is due in 3 days. It's something we were planning on doing for Environmental Club, and honestly, I don't remember what we even said we were going to do about it. I don't want to do or even think about Environmental Club of CSHS. It's not that bad, it's just that they seem of so minor significance compared to scioly and Science Fair. </p>
                <p>Also completely irrelevant, but my monitor broke so I'm kind of sad. I usually keep my monitor on even when my laptop is turned on, so it's hibernating, which probably isn't a good thing. It was working quite well until yesterday morning, when the panel wouldn't work at all. I don't know what exactly is wrong, and all the solutions online didn't do anything, so my best guess is that the controller on the monitor is still working because I can drag my cursor into the monitor area, but the panel is just broken. I'll have to send it for a repair soon. My dad is probably suspicious about why I'm using my laptop on my desk.</p>

                <p>I have so many things to do today. For school, I need to finish studying for AP Chem, do 2 BC progress checks and review everything we've learned, work on a Transcendentalism assignment for AP Lang, and study for the APUSH midterm. But at this moment I'm procrastinating and doing this. </p>

                <div class="entry-title">Entry: Sinewaves</div>
                <p class="timestamp">Wednesday 1.31.2024 10:00 PM</p>
                <p>I made an analogy some time ago about life: the sum of all our experiences is like a composite sinusoidal wave. Our life is always going up and down, and no matter what point of time we're in, we're feeling the worst or the best, or going from one to the other. We're never at a place with a constant velocity; no moment, no matter how precious or exhilarating, is fleeting and gone in an instant, replaced by another wave of emotions, for better or for worse.</p>
                <p>Today's trajectory was characterized by a single upward step amidst a bottomless plunge. I studied extensively last night for the BC Calculus test; I reviewed all of my previous tests, and I did plenty of timed practices. For the actual test, I felt pretty good about the MCQ, enough to hope that I aced it. But on the FRQ, I was an actual imbecile. I freaking typed the function I was given into the calculator wrong, which means I got half of the entire free response section wrong. I literally could have aced that test, but I messed up on the slightest task - typing sine squared into the calculator, instead of just sine like I did. I am such. An. Idiot. How could I have been so moronic? I am such a failure. </p>
                <p>During Spanish, we had a sub so I just finished my APUSH outline. I felt pretty good about that, since I had been planning to get an extension on it. But when APUSH actually happened, I died a little more. We had our midterm today, and although I studied a bit, I screwed up horribly, again - I got 43 out of 55 questions, or 78%. That's literally a failing grade. How was I so idiotic? The questions weren't hard and I had plenty of time. I did take a nap during the test and end twenty minutes early, but that shouldn't have affected my score too much. Mr. Roserbrock is supposed to like me too - but now I don't know how that will be possible now. </p>
                <p>Things got a little better when I got to scioly. Mrs. Babcock (unofficially) told me that I got first for my category in the school science fair. There were only three teams in computer science so it wasn't a great achievement, but I did feel a little better - I did a little fist pump, and Mrs. Babcock laughed. But then Sophia and Matthew and I had to tell her about Enzo being absent for Princeton. And after spending hours on my Detector probe, I got no results and accidentally shorted my circuit. I was such an idiot, again. I feel like a piece of trash. </p>
                <p>I'm stuck at the bottom of a deep crevasse. I don't know how to get out; the only thing I can do is wait until the sine wave starts going up again. But I don't know at all when that upward trajectory will begin. It could be right now, tomorrow morning, or maybe weeks later. Since my life's a sine wave, though, I bet it'll be sooner than I think.</p>
                <p>I'm listening to a Chopin song right now, titled Carnaval, Op. 9: XII. I added it to my playlist, but I didn't realize how good of a song it was. Maybe I should learn it. If only I had the time.</p>
                <p>I want to be closer to Mrs. Babcock. Why am I so unapproachable when I have a lot on me? I know she's so eager to talk to us about everything that's going on, and I want to talk to her too, but I just can't. I think the expression on my face discourages her. But at least I'm far closer to her than most students and the closeness between me and my other teachers. I think Raimondo doesn't like me much anymore, and Mr. Kim definitely doesn't think I try hard. Why do things have to be like this?</p>

                <div class="entry-title">Entry: Day After Princeton</div>
                <p class="timestamp">Sunday 2.4.2024 7:55 PM</p>
                <p>Yesterday was the Princeton University Science Olympiad Invitational. The top team, Europa (also known as States) alone competed at Princeton, while the Regionals teams (Callisto and Io) went to Fairfax. All three teams would have gone to Fairfax if not for the cancellation, but because it had to be moved to the day of Princeton, we had to split the teams.</p>
                <p>At first, Mrs. Babcock and I were skeptical about the performance of the Regionals teams. The Regionals teams never did well at Fairfax in the past since they were very poorly prepared. But we were absolutely blown away when they got 12 medals and 2nd place overall - beating teams from several other good schools, such as Langley and Lake Braddock. I think my Roadmap to Nationals is working - people are actually putting in the work to make notes and construct builds, and they're heavily reaping the rewards of their efforts. Here's a summary of their performance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2x 1st place (Air Trajectory, Disease)</li>
                    <li>3x 2nd place (Astronomy, Codebusters, WIDI)</li>
                    <li>5x 3rd place (Anatomy, Astronomy, Detector, Forestry, Towers)</li>
                    <li>1x 4th place (Fossils)</li>
                    <li>1x 6th place (Air Trajectory)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>They did significantly better than States last year, and now they're talking about beating States altogether. Their enthusiasm, coupled with their ability to perform, is a satisfying indicator of progress. </p>
                <p>States went beyond my expectations too. Here's how we did:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1x 1st place (Disease Detectives)</li>
                    <li>2x 4th place (Codebusters, Towers)</li>
                    <li>1x 5th place (Air Trajectory)</li>
                    <li>2x 6th place (Anatomy, Microbe)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Zahra actually performed so well. She won half of our medals and medaled in all of her events. It's wonderful having such a talented Secretary leading our team. </p>
                <p>The day of the comp was great, too. I got to explore the campus again, although less than last year because I was busy running from event to event. I had 5 events total, which was the most I've ever done, but that was actually less than the 6 events Matthew did.</p>
                <p>I did really well for Towers and Code, which I was kind of expecting - we've been preparing for the events for months. Detector and Fermi weren't that great because we didn't prepare ahead enough. As for Robot Tour, Matthew and I genuinely did really well - but we still didn't medal, which was super confusing. Our robot made two gates zones with obstacles and in our second and best run, the robot stopped 3 centimeters away at perfect time. Matthew and I were really hyped because this was pretty good, and when I talked to some other competitors in the scioly.org discord, they agreed. So I was kind of disappointed when I got 4th in Code and Towers but nothing in Robot. Apparently PUSO results are delayed because they're fixing Robot Tour scores, so hopefully they change for the better.</p>
                <p>Both Regionals and States performed beyond my wildest dreams yesterday. I'm so proud of them - especially Regionals for showing what we could do without the domination of the States team. I'm looking forward to winning more medals at Regionals.</p>

                <p>I should be asleep right now. I stayed up helping Indra with her gov school essay. I was glad to be able to help her, but I feel like I could have been more productive. Then again, sleeping instead of staying up hasn't done any good - I slept 8 hours last night and was the most tired in school than I had been for this entire week. </p>
                <p>Thankfully, Princeton released the full and corrected invitational results. Matthew and I got 4th at Robot Tour, which was both satisfying and kind of expected. It seemed really unlikely even during the award ceremony that six teams would have placed higher than us with our robot that was 3 centimeters off with perfect timing. </p>
                <p>Now my goal is to medal in all of my events at regionals - 1st in Code, 1st in Towers, 1st in Robot Tour, and a medal in Fermi. Actually, I need to improve my grades first - AP Lang is getting better but needs work, and my Spanish grade is doing well, but I really need to work on my Calculus grade.</p>
                <p>Sleep time now. I need to be awake for our full team party tomorrow.</p>

                <p>Another day where I got a lot of sleep but am still tired. I don't know why this happens; perhaps I'm so accustomed to getting little sleep before scioly competitions. Either way, I'm going to log off before 9:30 and do some APUSH before going to bed today so I fall asleep quickly.</p>
                <p>The scioly party happened yesterday. It was nice, and I think some people enjoyed it. During the first part when I was congratulating everyone on their performance, I told everyone how proud I was of them for doing so well, and the entire club started clapping for me. I know I grinned ear to ear then - just that moment made all of my struggles leading the club worth more than any medal. </p>
                <p>I realized how screwed my grades are. My Spanish grade right now is 97.2, which brings my final up to an A, but if it drops below that, I have a real possibility of failing Spanish. I also have an A- in APUSH because I failed the last DBQ (I got DBQs confused with Synthesis assignments in Lang), and my Lang grade is a 95.4, which is decent but not high enough to raise my grade. Actually, I need to get at least a 95.2 last quarter in order to end with an A, which I think is possible, but I'd definitely have to get a 6 on every timed writing from now on. But my worst grade is BC Calculus - I've been thinking it's been easy this entire time and that all of the points I lose are because of simple errors and not because it's difficult, but that just means the class <i>is</i> difficult. I'm going to have to ace the next test so that my midterm grade can raise my first semester grade.</p>
                <p>My parents are talking again, which makes me a good deal more stressed. </p>

                <p>I got a 6 on my last timed writing. That's two in a row. I'm actually so happy, because my Lang grade is well within the range of ending with an A. I have a sudden urge to work as hard as I can in that class. I like Mr. Annear more now, and I don't think he hates me as much. I really shouldn't have left a poor impression on him by sleeping and doing Calculus in his class.</p>
                <p>Regionals is in ten days. Nine now, since it passed 12 as I'm writing this (I haven't been writing for 30 minutes, I got distracted for a bit). It's so soon, and I need to increase my Fermi performance ASAP.</p>

                <p>Yesterday, I was hanging out on the balcony next to a trailer with some people in scioly when Mrs. Babcock asked what I was doing. When I told her we were just relaxing, she said "it's good to see you finally doing normal teenager activities." She also called me a robot - "how do you work nonstop?", she asked. I kind of just have to - there's too many things to do. But I'm also bad at doing all of them...</p>
                <p>MathWorks is coming up - it's in two weeks, the Saturday after Regionals. I really like the challenge and want to win this year. When I was talking to Lavanya during 2nd period, she suggested that I remove  and replace her with Morgan. Strategically, it's a good idea because Morgan is really smart, but I don't feel good about kicking Catherine out. She did compete last year, and I already asked if she wanted to be on the team. But Morgan is a better choice, so I think I'll go with her.</p>
                <p>Mr. Kim was annoyed when I was dozing off in class. I guess that's understandable given that I sit at the very front. Jamie and Harun said behind my back that I'm grouchy when I don't get enough sleep; I didn't realize before, but I guess it's true. </p>

                <p>I am so screwed for this week. Actually, I'm not. Actually, I very much am. I slacked off this weekend because, among other things, I began watching Invincible and got six and a half episodes through it. Normally, I'd say it was a waste of my time, but I actually like the series a lot. Good art and fast pace, just my type. I think the premise of Omni-Man as a father and Invincible as a son just my age made the story really relatable.</p>
                <p>I'm always screwed for Tuesdays because both enviro and my piano lesson are then. I guess I am worried about my APUSH exam and Chem FRQ this week, but those shouldn't be too bad. It's just that I feel terrible about not doing more work for enviro and that I don't want to disappoint my piano teacher. Last year, Ms. Kinne and Ella, the previous presient, asked if I needed a co-president to help me, since they knew I was busy. Well, I was an idiot egotist then and said I wouldn't need one, and look where I am now. I think I'll promote Victoria to co-president this year so I can focus more on scioly. Scioly's the only thing I really care about outside of academics at this school, anyways.</p>
                <p>Regionals is this Saturday. Ooh, and CONRAD results come out in four days, too. Just remembered. I don't expect anything for CONRAD, but I have been thinking about Regionals a bit. At Princeton, I breezed through my first three events - Towers, Code, and Robot Tour, because I knew I had prepared and performed well. The tower Katie made held five more kilos than we had expected and lost 0.2 grams after she dried it, resulting in an efficiency score of at least 3300, which we knew was in the medaling range. For Codebusters, the test was hard since some of the ciphers were obnoxiously long, but we still managed to do thirteen ciphers, and I felt pretty good then because I knew other teams would have struggled too. (On a side note, I ripped the Princeton code test too vigorously that the timed question paper ripped, so we had to get a new one. This put us back by a couple of seconds, and we later found out that 3rd place got a score of 3696, so if not for my rip, we might have taken their spot). Lastly, as I mentioned before, the robot Matthew and I made together did really well. I kind of expected to get medals for those events, so I slacked off on my other ones - I couldn't have done much more for Detector, but I did slack off for Fermi. I'm kind in the same spot now, five days before Regionals; I'm at the point where I'm a strong enough performer that I don't worry about my events, which is not exactly a good thing. But in reality, all I have to do is fix my Robot code, do timed practices for my individual ciphers, and practice Fermi on my own. </p>
                <p>There's one more thing I want to add - I was talking with Katie at the NOVA library today after we had done code, and I had the idea of having two MathWorks teams for our school and making them both compete. I could make a new team with Katie, Morgan, Indra, and Luke (maybe replace Catherine with Morgan, we'll have to see) and have everyone work together to submit two really cracked papers. I have to think more about it, but I don't have much time since MathWorks registration ends in four days. </p>
                <p>Okay, now time for work. I have to finish my outline, which isn't a priority - that's one thing I need to fix, setting my priorities straight for schoolwork. But that's for another time, and I have half an hour to write down some key concepts. </p>

                <p>Mrs. Babcock is disappointed in me. Our Scrambler teams are floundering; Callisto doesn't have a launcher, and Dr. McCormack doesn't approve of any of the designs. She asked what was going on with everything, and I didn't have an answer. I feel like shit.</p>

                <p>Actually, it wasn't that bad. The people on Scrambler came to work for a few hours, so babs was pretty chill.</p>
                <p>CONRAD results come out today. The foundation said they'd reach out to winning teams via email, so I'm nervously waiting for any form of contact. The longer we don't get a response, the more nervous we'll be. I think I'll have a hard time focusing during scioly today. </p>

                <p class="timestamp">Saturday 2.24.2024 11:03 PM</p>
                <p>Fairfax Regionals was today. Jamie and I didn't win CONRAD yesterday, and we were really sad until we went to bed. But none of that mattered - because WE! POPPED! OFF!</p>
                <p>Maybe I'll write about everything leading up to awards and final rankings another time. I'll just get into how we did: 1st overall, beating Langley with a superscore of 58. Europa medaled every single event except for Chem Lab (8th) and WIDI (7th). Io did really well and got 11 medals, and Callisto also did fairly well, with 4 medals. I genuinely thought we were going to lose to Langley, and even more so when they handed out trophies on a per-school, not per-team basis. But everyone completely exceeded my expectations, and we blew past the competition. I'm so proud of everyone, and I'm enthralled to see that my Roadmap to Nationsl is working. </p>
                <p>I'm especially proud of Dylan and WynSon, who medaled all of their events. Robot Tour was fantastic; all 3 teams medaled, and Matthew and I got first. It felt so rewarding to get my first 1st place medal. Brian and Lucas also did well, actually beating Dylan and Shaheer, getting 4th. I'm so proud of them, they put in so much time and effort into scioly. I'm also really proud of everyone on States; Lavanya got 1st in Astro, Ben did so well in Air Trajectory and his Earth Science events, James also medaled Forestry and Ecology; everyone did so so well. I'm really looking forward to preparing for and competing at States.</p>
                <p>I did medal all of my events, as did most people on States, but I was kind of disappointed with two of my results. Actually, more like one. Katie and I only got 4th for Towers which isn't ideal considering that we got 4th at Princeton, our Tower weighed 0.2 grams more, and held more than 2 kilograms less. But we did medal, which better than what I was expecting (that our Tower would hold less than 10 kilos). But for Codebusters, I was completely devastated when I got 2nd. Morgan was the second fastest to finish the timed question, but that wasn't the main thing - I was 90% through the Xenocrypt when time came up, but worst of all, the Fractionated Morse Cipher didn't count because the ES didn't include a Morse table. I was furious - what kind of idiot Event Supervisor doesn't provide a Morse chart for a test that has Morse? And can't teams just memorize Mors like they should? Anyways, I was super disappoined when I got 2nd. But I'll do everything I can to get 1st at States.</p>
                <p>My last event was Fermi, and we actually didn't do bad. Morgan and I threw at Princeton, and I thought we were bad at Fermi leading up to today, but the test turned out to be easy and we got 4th. That's not super great and it's the same as my Fermi score last Regional, but at least we didn't not medal. </p>
                <p>I don't think I'll be tired enough to sleep. I barely ate anything during the day; I nibbled on half a sandwich for lunch, was so hungry and sick that I couldn't eat, then got home and ate all of the fried rice Jamie bought so now I'm super full. I should get off my computer now; my medals are waiting to be labeled. </p>

                <p>The FCPS Regional Science and Engineering Fair was today. We didn't get Grand Prize nominee, which was really disappointing. </p>
                <p>I was kind of expecting that we'd do well. Our project was one of the few comptuer science ones in our category, and our board was the only long (6-foot tall) one. But we didn't get nominated, and the proejct next to us, a Woodson project, and another one did get nominated. I don't know what to say. Honestly, I'm just tired. 14 rounds of judging was a lot and I just want to get rest. But the weather's nice so I think I'll go on a run.</p>
                <p>Well, at least my grades are doing better. Or, they were, until they started dropping again. I got a 96 on the last Calculus test which was really good, bringing my quarter grade up to an A. But I failed a Spanish quiz I didn't study for, and Mr. Annear gave me a 5 on my last timed writing. I also have to fix my Data Structures grade because I haven't done any labs or exercises for this unit.</p>
                <p>Okay, run time now. I'm tired but there's nothing else I can do. </p>

                <p>I'm so tired right now. I want to sleep but I have to study for a Spanish quiz I'm retaking tomorrow. Everyone cheats in Spanish but I don't and hadn't studied the night before, so did pretty terribly.</p>
                <p>Why do I so easily break my word? Since last Friday, I was planning with Raimondo to work in his classroom after school today. But I ended up doing other work for Detector and didn't work in his room, so he just left. I felt pretty terrible. I also said I was going to do Code with Katie today, but I didn't until 5:00 since I was occupied with Detector so I basically made her waste a lot of time. I am so incompetent.</p>
                <p>It's hard to believe how close I am to the end of the year. Third quarter ends after two school days, and after that, it'll just be April, AP testing, and the last few days of school where we don't do much. Part of me is worried because my AP Lang, BC Calculus, and Spanish DE grades are borderline A's, but I'm also kind of sad - before I know it, I'll be writing college essays, then getting results, and sooner or later, I'll be living in a dorm hundreds of miles away. My childhood is on the rim of a canyon, and I can only imagine the expanse that lies below me, as it is covered in the impenetrable fog of youthful blindness. </p>

                <p>Now I know what it feels like to get ghosted. I emailed my SEAP researcher about my forms and her plans for the summer. She responded in 30 minutes, and I responded pretty quickly as well, but she hasn't said anything. Now I kind of bad for not responding to her for 10 days lol.</p>

                <p>I finally got my Detector working. At least, I think so. The voltage readings I've been getting vary somewhat consistently according to concentration. I have yet to make a calibration curve, but I'll do that after I get home from my piano lesson.</p>
                <p>I've procrastinated a good deal this break - I did a lot of code practice and Robot work, but nothing for Science Fair. The only schoolwork I've done was my President's notebook, which was a decent use of my time, but my calculus and lang work remains untouched. I'll have a lot to do today and tomorrow. Oh, and I also have to study for Detector. The chemistry is kind of too hard to cram into the next few days, but I'll have to do my best...</p>
                <p>On a brighter note, Morgan and Katie and I have been doing a lot better on Code tests recently. We got 1st at the Seven Lakes Invitational and broke 8000 points, and got 7194 on another test all in a single day. We've consistently been getting 1st and 2nd at other nationally competitive invitationals, so I'm actually looking forward to States. Also, Virginia is apparently next in line for two Division C Nationals bids, which really gives me hope of going to Nats this year. </p>

                <p>I got 1st place medals in Code, Fermi, and Robot. I got 8th in Detector and 11th in Towers. 4th overall with team score of 152. Very bad.</p>
                <p>I'm sick right now and have a calculus test today, but I think I'll be skipping given how badly in shape I am right now. So many things are happening with my piano competition, school, science fair, my friends, scioly, everything... I almost can't handle it.</p>

                <p class="timestamp">Tuesday 4.9.2024 12:38 PM</p>
                <p>So. I skipped school yesterday. Looking back, it wasn't the right choice. No matter how sick I was, I should have tried harder to finish my homework and study for the test. Running away from my problems is not the way to fix them. I vow to not make that mistake again. </p>
                <p>I skipped a number of things yesterday - my Calculus test, a Spanish vocab quiz, and a good amount of instruction for APUSH. At least I got some time to study; I took the calc FRQ during 4th returns, and it wasn't too bad (but that could also mean I failed completely).</p>
                <p>I don't know how to feel about Saturday. We did so much worse than I thought we did, but our performance directly correlated to how we prepared leading up to States. In the end, the studies carried the day except for Chem Lab, and the builds dragged us down tremendously. Matthew and I should not have done 5 events, and I have no idea what Ada was thinking for Flight and WIDI. Regionals went too perfectly - all the builds did better than we thought, and we medaled almost every event. It was naive us of to assume that States would go just as well as Regionals. We need more in-person invitationals - Babs definitely agrees - and we have to prepare nonstop between Regionals and States.</p>
                <p>There are so many things I have to think through about States. I also need to come up with a new officer application process and think about what leadership roles I want to create. I need some running and shower time to develop my thoughts.</p>
                <p>As for my own events, I don't know how to feel. Code and Robot were satisfying victories - given the number of practices Katie and Morgan I did, along with the countless times I practiced with my robot, I would have been dismayed to receive anything other than gold. 8th in Detector was a disappointment but not unexpected, because I had stayed up studying the wrong topic (Galvanic cells instead of Nernst equations), which threw me off because the test had a lot about Nernst equations. I probably should have expected the test to cover Nernst equations, but all the invitational tests I looked at had some sort of Galvanic cell question and almost never mentioned the Nernst equation. Towers was a disaster, but it was completely preventable, making it tragic. When Katie was picking out the legs, one of the lighter pieces had a small chink, and we didn't think it would matter much so we just put some glue on it, but that turned out to be a weak point and the tower broke at 5 kilograms.</p>
                <p>Fermi was completely unexpected. The test wasn't bad, but I had been so busy that week preparing for my other events so I hadn't been able to take a full practice test on my own, much less with Morgan. When I walked out of the classroom, I was sure we weren't medaling. During the award ceremony, when 2nd place BASIS was announced, I lost all hope for a moment, since I had gotten 2nd last year and was sure that I hadn't place first. But lo and behold, we got first and the entire team exploded with cheers. That was a moment to remember.</p>
                <p>I also met Hailey's mom at States. She pulled me aside to have a talk and it was... disconcerting. I talked with Indra about it. I'll write about it later. </p>

                <p>I drove for about an hour on the day down to Norfolk today for the Virginia State Science and Engineering fair. When we were on the long bridge, I could see the tall, angled radio tower of a <i>Zumwalt</i>-class guided missile destroyer. It was kind of cool seeing it in person, even from a distance.</p>
                <p>While I was driving, my mom kept telling me to push the speed so I went at 80 miles per hour for a good thirty minutes. It wasn't too bad and surprisingly there wasn't too much traffic, which was nice. I've started driving by myself more, and I found out that driving alone is better than driving with your parents. Sure, you can't ask them anything, but something about guiding the car in solitude is calming.</p>
                <p>Mr. Annear knows so much and yet so little about literature. He knows a wide range of topics, but never in too much depth - he brought up <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> in class, and I had to remind him how the book ended. He also hasn't read many of the works we covered in class such as Benjamin Franklin's autobiography and <i>Walden</i>, so it was kind of a bummer when he couldn't talk about either because both are really great works.</p>
